# Django Docker Image

This Docker image is a complete solution for running Django applications in a containerized environment. Built on top of Ubuntu, it includes Python, pip, and virtual environment support to isolate and manage dependencies efficiently. The image is tailored for both local development and deployment in production-like environments, such as AWS EC2 instances or other cloud platforms.

## Key Features
- **Pre-configured Environment**: Includes Python 3 and pip, eliminating the need to manually set up the environment.
- **Dependency Management**: Uses a virtual environment within the container to isolate dependencies from the system Python, ensuring consistent behavior across builds.
- **Port Exposure**: Exposes port 8000 by default, allowing easy access to the Django development server from your local machine or cloud instances.
- **Simple Integration**: Ready to work with Django applications; just copy your code and `requirements.txt`, and you're good to go.

## Use Cases
- **Local Development**: Quickly spin up a containerized Django development environment without worrying about system dependencies.
- **Testing**: Use the isolated environment to test changes without impacting your host system.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy your Django applications on cloud platforms like AWS EC2, with straightforward configuration and port mapping.

This image is designed to minimize setup time and maximize productivity, making it easier to focus on building and running your Django applications.
